# boxing-game

A game utilizing mediapipe.js to track arm movements and map it to a character hitting a boxing bag(or two)
* Stand before your camera
* Start moving your arms (punching) to hit the bags and earn points

Note: I've noticed that the camera feed appears to be inverted on a few devices, simply download the file and invert camera direction as per needs :)

# Have Fun!
